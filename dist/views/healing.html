Death is still a very uncomfortable subject for the vast majority of us, particularly in western cultures. Even close family members can have difficulty sharing their desires and fears openly with their loved ones when one of them is near death. As a result, those who are dying often feel they must keep worries, thoughts, fear and grief to themselves. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>When you visit</h4> <p> The most helpful thing to do when you visit someone who is dying is to relax any tension in the atmosphere in whatever way comes most easily and naturally. People will die as they have lived, as themselves. Those who are very sick often long to be touched, long to be treated as living people and not as diseases or injuries. Most know they are dying. They notice when you keep your distance or pretend there will be many other such visits. A great deal of consolation can be given to the very ill simply by touching their hands, looking into their eyes, holding them or breathing in the same rhythm gently with them. The body has its own language of love; use it and you will find you bring comfort and consolation. </p> <p> If you feel anxiety and fear, and don’t know what to do, admit that openly to the dying person, and ask. He or she knows far better than we how they can be helped and what they want and you give them the opportunity to tell you. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>Facing the fear of death</h4> <p> Being aware of your own fears about dying will help you to be aware of the fears of the dying person. For most of us, we will be unable to be at ease with the dying until we have acknowledged to ourselves how their dying disturbs us and brings up our own most uncomfortable fears. </p> <p> Just imagine deeply what those fears might be: fear of increasing, uncontrollable pain, fear of suffering, fear of indignity, fear of dependence, fear that the lives we have led have been meaningless, fear of separation from all we love, fear of losing control. Perhaps our greatest fear of all is fear of fear itself, which grows more and more powerful the more we try and evade it. </p> <p> Usually when we feel fear, we feel isolated and alone, and without company. But when somebody keeps company with you and talks of his or her own fears, then you realize fear is universal, and the edge, the personal pain, is taken off of it. Your fears are brought back to the human and universal context. Then you are able to understand, be more compassionate, and deal with your own fears in a much more positive and inspiring way. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>Being forthright and truthful</h4> <p> People often ask, Should people be told they are dying? And I always say: Yes, as quietly, as kindly, as sensitively, and as skillfully as possible.  Elizabeth Kubler-Ross observed that, Most, if not all, of the patients know anyway. They sense it by the changed attention, by the new and different approach that people take to them, by the lowering of voices or avoidance of sounds, by the tearful face of a relative or ominous, unsmiling member of the family who cannot hide his or her true feelings. </p> <p> People often instinctively know they are dying but rely on others — their doctor or loved ones — to confirm it. If they don’t, the dying person may think it is because family members cannot cope with the news. And then the dying person won’t bring up the subject either. This lack of honesty will make them feel even more isolated and anxious. I believe it’s essential to tell the dying person the truth. If the dying are not told the truth, how can they prepare themselves for death? How can they bring the most important relationships of their lives to a true and meaningful conclusion? How can they take care of the many practical issues they must resolve? How can they help those who will be left to carry on? </p> <p> Dying is a great opportunity for people to come to terms with their lives. Many individuals take this opportunity, in the most inspiring way, to change themselves and come closer to their own deepest truth. So by kindly and sensitively telling people at the earliest opportunity they are dying, we are really giving them the chance to prepare, and to find their own powers of strength, and the meaning of their lives. </p> <p> Sometimes people ask, What should I tell my child about the death of their relative? It’s important to be sensitiv e to the child, but to tell the truth. Don’t let the child think that death is something strange or terrifying. Let her take part as much as possible in the life of the dying person, and answer honestly any questions they have. A child’s directness can really bring a sweetness, lightness, even sometimes humor into the pain of dying. Encourage the child to pray for the dying person, so they can feel they are really doing something to help. After the death, be sure to give the child special attention and affection. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>Reconciliation</h4> <p> When death is approaching, people often have a lot of anxiety about leaving unfinished business behind. Sometimes people are afraid to let go and die because they haven’t come to terms with what they have been and done. And when a person dies harboring guilt or bad feelings toward others, those who survive them may suffer even more deeply in their grief. </p> <p> It’s never too late for healing old wounds near the end of one’s life; even after enormous pain and abuse, people can find a way to forgive each other. The moment of death has a grandeur, solemnity, and finality that can make people reexamine all of their previous attitudes, and be more open and ready to forgive, when before they couldn’t bear to. Even at the very end of a life, the mistakes of a lifetime can be undone. </p> <p> Forgiveness is really about giving up the need to continue to punish someone for ways they have hurt us in the past. It can be about your forgiving them or them forgiving you. If we can allow ourselves to imagine being in the dying person’s place as previously mentioned, we can begin to realize how much forgiveness could mean to them, even if at first they are too afraid to be aware of that need. The great matter of life and death can be seen to relegate old hurts to being trivial and certainly forgivable by comparison. We only need to be willing to open ourselves courageously to the vast mystery of life and death to see how we all share the desires and fears of a lifetime that have caused us to hurt friends and loved ones without really knowing what we were doing. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>Saying goodbye and letting go</h4> <p> It is not only the tensions that we have to learn to let go of, but the dying person as well. If we are excessively attached and clinging too tightly to the person who is dying, we make it very hard for the person to let go and die peacefully. </p> <p> Sometimes the dying person will tell you they want to say good-bye. Honor that wish and use it as an opportunity to express your love. Don’t miss the moment by assuring them there will be another visit, another time. Many people know when their death is imminent. </p> <p> Others are not ready or otherwise unable to take control; they hold on, even when in great pain. Researchers have concluded the dying often need to hear two very explicit assurances from loved ones. First, loved ones must give the person permission to die. Second, they must reassure the person they will be all right after he or she goes, and there is no need to worry about them. One very powerful way to give people permission to die is to say, with the deepest and most sincere tenderness: I am here with you and I love you. You are dying, and that is completely natural; it happens to everyone. I wish you could stay here with me, but I don’t want you to suffer anymore. The time we have had together has been enough, and I shall always cherish it. Please now don’t hold onto life any longer. Let go. I give you my full and heartfelt permission to die. You are not alone, now or ever. You have all my love. </p> <p> Each friend or family member may be at a different stage of acceptance. Some people resist letting the loved one go, thinking that to do so is a betrayal, a sign that they don’t love them enough. For those people, the following may help. Picture yourself standing on the deck of an ocean liner, about to set sail. You can look back and see your whole family standing on the shore waving goodbye. You have no choice about leaving, and the ship is already moving away. How would you want the people you love to be saying goodbye to you? What would help you most on your journey? Do that for the dying person. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>Providing a peaceful atmosphere</h4> <p> I intuitively feel that here in the West we have made a lot of progress in recent years towards creating calm and harmonious environments for people dying. By being willing to learn from other cultures that have been more accepting and in touch with the depth of life that manifests with the death of a loved one, we have learned to use our imaginations to create more powerful and loving conditions for death to be a more beneficial and less painful process. </p> <p> In many cases, in my view, it’s best if people can die at home because it is where the majority of people are likely to feel most comfortable. And a peaceful death is easiest to obtain in peaceful surroundings. If the dying person has a particular faith that they wish to find expression for as the process unfolds, it can be helpful to build a shrine in the home or hospital room if necessary. People can really be helped by the atmosphere this can create, and they will appreciate your imagination and creativity in aiding them in producing an atmosphere in which they feel most comfortable. The resulting spirit of devotion and peace of mind can be very empowering for the person, and can greatly inspire people to make their dying a sacred process. </p> <p> Most people die in a state of unconsciousness. One fact we have learned from the near death experience is that comatose and dying patients may be much more aware of things around them than we realize. Many of the near-death experiences are reported as out of body experiences, from which they are able to give surprisingly accurate detailed accounts of their surroundings and even, in some cases, of other rooms in the same hospital. This clearly shows the importance of talking positively and frequently to a dying person or to a person in a coma. Conscious, alert, and actively loving care for the dying person must go on until the last moments of their life. The hospice movement has done much to help families of the dying to find ways to make the difficult transition of death as easy, painless, and peaceful as possible. </p> <p> <i> Dr. Roger Shikan Hawkins is an instructor in Zen Buddhism and has a PhD in psychology.

Solomon, Ph.D.</h3> <p> The death of a loved one can be very painful. The mourner can be confronted with particularly difficult challenges at a time of often unparalleled distress. Grieving is a natural process and involves feeling many different emotions. Over time, a person comes to accept and understand their loss, and come to terms with it. Each person suffering a loss goes through the process in their own way. The length and intensity of the reactions and emotions people go through vary from person to person. </p> <p> Initially there is a Shock Phase, with a person likely to experience disbelief and numbness. A person may feel emotionally flat and can’t belief it happened – it just does not feel real. It may be difficult to recognize, acknowledge and understand the loss. This is a normal defense mechanism of the mind that helps protect a person from being overwhelmed and to absorb the loss as he or she is able to. Nevertheless, it is normal to feel waves of distress, especially when one is reminded of the loved one. During this time, the mourner may feel weak, agitated and anxious, cry, engage in aimless activities, or be preoccupied with thoughts or images of the person they lost. It is common to yearn for the loved one, missing him or her, shedding many tears and being preoccupied with thoughts of the loved one. </p> <p> At some point the shock begins to wear off (not uncommonly 6 to 9 months later or even longer) and the emotional impact and reality of the situation is felt. This is sometimes called the Confrontation Phase. This is when a person begins to react to the separation and experience the pain. The mourner may, at times, feel very sad and may withdraw from others, have low energy and feel blue and depressed. Fear is quite common “ what will life will be like without the loved one? There may be significant changes in one’s life, which can be considered secondary losses. You not only lost someone you love, but perhaps a companion, a friend, a lover, a playmate. </p> <p> Another common reaction is survival guilt (I feel guilty for living/surviving ¦ it should have been me that died ). Many people have regrets for things left unsaid or dreams unfulfilled. A mourner may feel guilty for not doing enough. A mourner may feel responsibility guilt–the guilt that comes from blaming yourself for things beyond your control – becaus e it is difficult to accept that one was helpless and nothing more could be done, or the death could not be prevented. It is common to feel angry -angry at the situation, at other people involved in the death (e.g. hospital staff, driver of the other car, etc.) and even angry at the loved one who died for dying and leaving him/her alone. </p> <p> There can be cognitive symptoms, such as trouble concentrating, forgetfulness, difficulty finishing tasks, difficulty making decisions, and being absent minded. So, after a significant loss, it may be best to put off making major, life-changing decisions for a while until there has been time to understand and work through the emotional impact. </p> <p> Physical symptoms include lack of energy, sleep difficulties, muscle tightness or weakness, body pains, digestive upset or physical signs of anxiety (rapid breathing and heart rate, increase in blood pressure). If physical signs of anxiety are intense, a physician should be consulted. Again, these are normal reactions and the key is to cope with them, not try to avoid it or suppress it. </p> <p> It is often during this time that a grieving person needs the most emotional support. Constructive support from family members, friends, support groups, community organizations or mental health professions can make a big difference in a person’s recovery from the trauma of loss, and acceptance of the loss. </p> <p> With time, the mourner transitions into the Accommodation Phase. As time goes on, the emotions will soften and the intensity will lessen. A person begins to recognize the meaning of the loss to them and slowly (over many months) comes to deal with the pain and accept the loss. This acceptance includes adjusting to daily life without the deceased; that is, moving from loving in presence to loving in absence. It is quite common for it to take over a year for someone to adapt to the emotional and life changes that come with the loss of a loved one. Though the pain becomes less intense with time, it is normal to feel emotionally involved and attached with the deceased for many years after their death. In time, the person is able to invest emotional energy into life and other relationships. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>Coping with loss</h4> <p> With time and support the mourner works through the grief and comes to accept and make sense of the loss, and adapt to a new life and identity. The following tips may be helpful in coping: </p> <ul> <li> Allow yourself to feel the pain and all the other emotions, associated with loss. Be mindful of what you are feeling and experiencing. You don’t have to jump into the feelings or avoid them, just notice them, feel them without judgment or criticism. </li> <li> Express your feelings. Let yourself cry. Both are important for healing. </li> <li> Don’t tell yourself how to feel or let others tell you how you should feel. It is okay for you to feel what you feel and go through the process at your own pace. No one can tell you how you should mourn and when to stop. </li> <li> Learn relaxation skills. </li> <li> Get the support you need. Talk about your loss, its meaning to you, and your memories. Ask others for what you need. </li> <li> It can be helpful to talk to others who have lost a loved one. Find a support group in the community that provides such support. </li> <li> Try to maintain your normal lifestyle. Your life routines provide a sense of control and continuity. Give yourself some time (e.g. at least six months to a year) to adapt and think things through before making a major life change (e.g. change in job, moving, a change in important relationships). </li> <li> Take good care of yourself. Eat well and healthy. Exercise – physical activity is a good way to release stress tension and combat depression. </li> <li> Enjoy small physical pleasures that help you renew yourself, special treats (your favorite gelato), massage, hot baths, naps, etc. </li> <li> Avoid drinking too much alcohol or using other drugs. This can interfere with sleep, increase physical stress, dull your emotions, and make depression worse. </li> <li> Save compassion for yourself. Understand what was under your control and beyond your control. When you are ready, forgive yourself and others for all the things you did or didn’t do or say. </li> <li> Engage in hobbies and recreation “ activities that involve you in life. It is helpful to take a break from grief and find things to enjoy such as going to movies, concerts, reading a good book, and indulging in other fun or meaningful activities. </li> <li> Allow yourself to remember your loved one and feel your feelings. Special ceremonies, rituals, viewing important keepsakes help one to go through the grieving process. </li> <li> Prepare for birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries knowing that strong feelings may be evoked. Decide if you want to keep certain traditions or create new ones. Do some advance planning regarding how you want to celebrate, and with whom. Do something to honor the memory of your loved one. </li> <li> Join a bereavement support group. Sharing experience with others who have gone through what you have can normalize and validate your experience. Other people can be a source of encouragement, guidance, and comfort. There are also many online resources. </li> </ul> <p> Helpful activities that enable you to feel and remember in constructive ways are: </p> <ul> <li> Write a letter to the person who died to say everything you wish you could say to your loved one. </li> <li> Volunteer. Helping others can give life purpose and fulfill the need to do something. </li> <li> Keep a journal. </li> <li> Make a scrapbook. </li> <li> Express yourself artistically (e.g. paint a picture, write poetry) </li> <li> Plant a tree or flowers </li> <li> Create a special tribute or memorial to your loved one. Remembering is important and necessary for adapting to the loss. Not all your memories may be good ones, and understand that all human relationships have problems and painful moments. </li> <li> Getting involved in meaningful causes or activities your loved one enjoyed. </li> <li> Talk to a therapist or grief counselor to help you better understand and work through the emotional impact of the loss. </li> <li> Read books on grief and coping with loss. Self-help books can enable you to increase your ability to cope. </li> <li> Understand that a current loss can trigger past losses and memories. </li> </ul> <p> <i> Dr. Solomon is a specialist in grief and trauma at the Buffalo Center for Trauma and Loss. He is on the Senior Faculty of the EMDR Institute, a consultant with the Employee Assistance Program of the US Senate, and a consulting psychologist with the South Carolina Department of Public Safety and the South Carolina Army National Guard. </i> </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>Six stages of grief</h4> <p> There are six stages most likely to be encountered on one’s journey through grief – what some grief experts call the “reconciliation needs of mourning.” For while your journey will be an intensely personal, unique experience, everybody who mourns must yield to this set of basic human needs if they are to heal. </p> <ol type="1"> <li> <p> <strong>Acknowledging the reality of the death</strong>This first need of mourning involves gently confronting the reality that someone you care about will never physically come back into your life again. Whether the demise was sudden or anticipated, acknowledging the full reality of the loss may occur over several weeks or months. To survive, you may try to push away the reality of the death at times. You may discover yourself replaying events surrounding the demise and confronting memories, both good and bad. This replay is a vital part of this need of mourning. It’s as if each time you talk it out, the event is a little more real. This first need of mourning, like the others, may intermittently require your attention for months. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you work on each of them. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Embracing the pain or loss</strong>This need of mourning requires us to embrace the pain of our loss – something we naturally don’t want to do. It is easier to avoid, repress or deny the pain of grief than it is to confront it, yet it is in confronting our pain that we learn to reconcile ourselves to it. You will probably discover that you need to “dose” yourself in embracing your pain. In other words, you cannot (nor should you try to) overload yourself with the hurt all at one time. Sometimes you may need to distract yourself from the pain, while at other times you will need to create a safe place to move toward it. Our culture tends to encourage the denial of pain, this is unfortunate. If you openly express your feelings of grief, misinformed friends may advise you to “carry on” or “keep your chin up”. On the other hand if you remain “strong” and “in control”, you may be congratulated for “doing well” with your grief. Doing well with your grief means becoming well acquainted with your pain. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Remembering the person who passed away</strong> Can you have any kind of relationship with someone when they die? Of course you can. You have a relationship of memory. Precious memories, dreams reflecting the significance of the relationship and objects that link you to the person who passed away such as mementos, photos, souvenirs, etc. are just a few of the things to give testimony to a different form of a continued relationship. This need of mourning involves allowing and encouraging yourself to pursue this relationship. But some people may try to take your memories away. Trying to be helpful, they encourage you to take down all the photos of the person who passed away. They tell you to keep busy or even to move out of your house. In my experience, remembering the past makes hoping for the future possible. Your future becomes open to new experiences only to the extent that you embrace the past. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Developing a new self-identity</strong> Part of your self-identity comes from the relationships you have with other people. When someone with whom you have a relationship dies, your self-identity — or the way you see yourself — naturally changes. You may have gone from being a wife or husband to a widow or widower. You may have gone from being a parent to a bereaved parent. The way you define yourself and the way society defines you has changed. A death often requires you to take on new roles that had been filled by the loved one who departed. You confront your changed identity every time you do something that used to be done by the person who died. This can be very hard work, something that frequently leaves one drained. You may occasionally feel child-like as you struggle with your changing identity. You may feel a temporarily heightened dependence on others as well as feelings of helplessness, frustration, inadequacy and fear. Many people discover that as they work on this need, they ultimately discover some positive aspects of their changed self-identity. You may develop a renewed confidence in yourself. You may develop a more caring, kind and sensitive part of yourself. You may develop an assertive part of your identity that empowers you to go on living even though you continue to feel a sense of loss. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Searching for meaning</strong>When someone you love passes away, you naturally question the meaning and purpose of life. You will probably question your philosophy of life and explore religious and spiritual values as you work through your grief. You may discover yourself searching for meaning in your continued living as you ask “How” and “Why” questions. How could God let this happen? Why did this happen now, in this way? The passing of a loved one reminds you of your lack of control. It can leave you feeling powerless. You mourn the loss outside and inside. At times, overwhelming sadness and loneliness may be your constant companions. Now you are faced with finding some meaning in going on with your life even though you may often feel so empty. The death of a loved one calls for you to confront your own spirituality. You may doubt your faith and have spiritual conflicts and questions racing through your head and heart. This is normal and part of your journey toward renewed living. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Receiving ongoing support from others</strong>The quality and quantity of understanding support you get during your grief journey will have a major influence on your capacity to heal. You cannot – nor should you try to – do this alone. Drawing on the experiences and encouragement of friends, fellow mourners or professional counselors is not a weakness but a healthy human need. Mourning is a process that takes place over time. This support must be available months and even years after the death of someone in your life. Unfortunately, because our society places so much value on the ability to “carry on,” “keep your chin up” and “keep busy,” many mourners are abandoned shortly after the event of the death. “It’s over and done with” and “It’s time to get on with your life” are the types of messages directed at mourners that still dominate. Obviously, these messages encourage you to deny or repress your grief rather than express it. To be truly helpful, the people in your support system must appreciate the impact this death has made on you and your life. They must understand that in order to heal, you must be allowed – even encouraged – to mourn long after the death. They must encourage you to see mourning not as an enemy but as a necessity to be experienced. </p> </li> </ol> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>Reconciling your grief</h4> <p> Many believe their grief journey will end when they resolve, or recover from, their grief. But the journey will never end. People do not “get over” grief. Reconciliation is a more appropriate term for what occurs as the mourner works to integrate the new reality of moving forward in life without the physical presence of the person who passed away. With reconciliation comes a renewed sense of energy and confidence, an ability to fully acknowledge the reality of the death and a capacity to become re-involved in the activities of living. In reconciliation, the sharp, ever-present pain of grief gives rise to a renewed sense of meaning and purpose. Your feeling of loss will not completely disappear, yet they will soften, and the intense pangs of grief will become less frequent. Hope for a continued life will emerge as you are able to make commitments to the future, realizing that the person who died will never be forgotten, yet knowing that your life can and will move forward. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row" id="movingFromPain"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>Moving from Pain to Peace</h4> <h5>By Dr. Francine Shapiro, PhD</h5> <p> While we all face mortality and death, few things cause more grief than the loss of a loved one. When this happens it is important to accept the comfort and nurturing of others, and to allow ourselves to mourn and grieve in our own way. Some receive solace from faith, others by celebrating the person’s life with friends and family. At the same time, it is important for us to recognize that emotional pain and loneliness are natural responses and can take some time to resolve. Letting yourself feel your emotions, rather than trying to shut them off or push them down, is an important part of the healing process. </p> <p> The brain is designed to process the loss of a loved one so that what is useful is maintained and what is useless is discarded. Over time, the negative emotions (sorrow, anger, guilt) and disturbing thoughts gradually diminish, allowing you to reenter life with renewed vitality and purpose”just as a loved one would want for you. However, at times this natural process can be derailed and the negative responses do not fade. This is a physical problem, where the experience is stored in the wrong form of memory. If this has occurred, it is important to receive help to jump start the healing processes of the brain. </p> <p> EMDR therapy is internationally recognized as an effective trauma treatment by organizations such as the World Health Organization, American Psychiatric Association and the Department of Defense. More than two dozen studies support the clinical effects of EMDR therapy, and another dozen have demonstrated that the eye movement component used in this therapy causes a decrease in negative emotions, and an increased recognition of true information. Many researchers believe the eye movements affect working memory, as well as mobilize the same brain processes that occur with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. During REM sleep the brain is supposed to process disturbing life experiences. When events are too distressing, the system can become overwhelmed. At this time it’s important to get assistance. </p> <p> EMDR therapy stimulates the needed brain functions to rapidly process the stuck memories. It is particularly useful for assisting people lay their grief to rest, no matter what their symptoms, no matter how their loved ones died. Read through the rest of this section to understand the kinds of symptoms you may have and when to reach out for help. </p> <p> Many people in mourning have a sense of being stuck in the sadness, along with horrible images that continue to stab their heart. Particularly when someone dies suddenly, the person can be haunted by feelings of guilt as they think of all the things they should have said or done”and didn’t do when they had the chance. It is important to understand that feelings of guilt may simply be a symptom of the stuck memories. Just because you feel it, doesn’t make it true. Those feelings of responsibility are often increased by images of their loved ones in pain. The memories often remain unprocessed and can cause grief to continue for years. For others, even if there is no guilt, there are only negative memories that </p> <p> There are people who are stuck because they are afraid that by letting go of the pain of the loss, they will not honor the dead or no longer feel a connection. This simply isn’t true. The emotional connections will be there, without the pain. Just as any loved one would wish for you. </p> <p> Loss threatens our deeply held conviction that life is supposed to go on in a predictable, unchanging manner. Once we lose someone we love deeply, it’s hard to feel safe ourselves. Sometimes we may feel anger at the departed for leaving us. While those feelings are natural, when they don’t change over time, it’s important to get professional assistance. We can move from pain to forgiveness and peace. </p> <p> Although the grieving process tends to benefit from the passage of time, how long should a person wait? There are no easy answers. Someone with profound spiritual beliefs, and in the right circumstances, may see death as a release for the loved one. Others take months to stop blaming themselves — and the universe — for their loss. For still others, grief goes on and on. Aspects about the death interact with past experiences, and the pain doesn’t heal over time. They feel as though life has stopped, except for the unremitting pain. A further complication is that the mourner may think this is normal or believe that to feel less would be dishonoring the dead. But being bombarded by pain, or being able to think of only the most distressing memories does not do the deceased, or ourselves any justice. </p> <p> If the intensity of emotions has not changed over a three-month period, mourners should be encouraged to reach out for help. The following books can tell you more about why you or they are experiencing symptoms, when people can benefit from help and how to find a trained EMDR therapist. The first book listed also teaches techniques you can use yourself to help change negative thoughts and feelings. </p> <ul> <li> Shapiro, F. (2012).

The desire to postpone dealing with the practicalities associated with death can be overpowering. Those who have experienced the unplanned death of a loved one, however, will tell you that the tasks and decision-making can be crippling, particularly when they’re made in a vacuum and at a time when loss can be incapacitating. Ignorance is not bliss. Do what you can to prepare. </p> <p> There are a multitude of legal, financial and practical decisions required in the days, weeks and months immediately before and after a death. Some of those we expect; others may not even occur to us. The following are what we call The Essentials. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row" id="layingGroundwork"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>Laying the Groundwork</h4> <p> Failing to plan for the inevitable isn’t fair to your loved ones. Failing to help a loved one tie up his or her affairs before they die is unkind. Just do it. </p> <p> The more you are able to prepare, the easier it will be for your family or heirs to carry out your wishes. Here are some of the things you can do to make the process easier: </p> <p> <strong>Obtain and sign a healthcare and end-of-life directive</strong>, which informs family and healthcare providers what measures must be taken if you are severely injured or disabled. The required information and language varies from state to state. Make sure you execute one that complies with the law of your or your loved one’s state. Most hospitals have forms that can be obtained at the information desk, whether or not you are a patient there. A simple search that includes your state’s name usually will identify a form that has been created by the state government. </p> <p> <strong>Tips:</strong> </p> <ul> <li> Most states require that the directive be signed by you and at least one witness, but often do not require a notary. </li> <li> Share the directive(s) with family so they will know and be able to implement your wishes. Make sure healthcare providers have copies. </li> </ul> <br> <p> <strong>Make a will.</strong> There is no reason not to have a will and every reason to have one. </p> <p> Even if you have no assets and don’t care what happens to your personal property, a will can insure that whatever you do possess will go to people who care about you or a charity that could use it. If you don’t own real estate, don’t have substantial assets and aren’t a parent, it’s likely you can find a form on the Web. Laws vary from state to state, so there is no one form that fits all, but there are basics that repeat. The big differences tend to be in who needs to witness it and how signatures are verified. </p> <p> For most people, it is a good idea to consult an attorney. In particular, if you have children or you’re married and only one of you works, you owe it to your family to have a will that puts your financial and legal affairs in order and that you know is binding. It also is good to have someone outside the family have a copy of the will for safekeeping. </p> <p> Every will identifies the heirs or beneficiaries — the people who will inherit from you – and names an executor, the person who makes sure the property is distributed in the manner required by the will. A lawyer can be the executor but more often it is a spouse, parent or child. In some states, however, the executor cannot be a beneficiary. Check state laws before deciding how to proceed. </p> <strong>Tips</strong> <ol type="1"> <li> If you are looking for a form, make sure you include your state of residence in your Internet search. Take a look at the URL of whatever sites come up to make sure it’s the right state. </li> <li> State bar associations tend to be good sources for simple wills and for referrals to attorneys. </li> <li> Many counties have family law centers that provide will and guardianship forms as well as consultations with attorneys. </li> <li> The most important attribute for an executor is that he or she be trustworthy, capable and able to perform the functions. Make sure you consider this carefully, tell beneficiaries who it is and confirm that the person is willing to do it. </li> </ol> <br> <br> <p> <strong>Consider a Trust.</strong> Another common way to distribute property is through a trust. Trusts are frequently created in conjunction with wills and define how money and property will be handled. For some, there are tax advantages to creating trusts. When people create a legal trust, they turn over all rights to designated properties to a “trustee.” The trustee is given legal title to the trust property, but is obligated to act for the good of the beneficiaries. The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed, but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties. Estate attorneys can simplify the process for non-attorneys in cases of complicated trusts or complex family relationships, particularly if an executor or trustee is from out of state. Choosing a trustee should be done as carefully as choosing an executor of a will. </p> <br> <p> <strong>Execute Powers of Attorney</strong> (POAs) identifying people who will take over decision-making in the event of your or your loved one’s death or incapacitation. These are legally binding documents and cover many areas of life, ranging from granting the ability to access bank records and write checks to making end-of-life decisions or acting as guardians of your minor children. The forms vary from state to state and most states provide a specific form. In some states, there are separate powers of attorney for financial/legal powers and medical powers. The form will let you determine when or under what circumstances the POA becomes active and for how long. They can be found on-line. POAs end when a person dies. In other words, they do not take the place of a will but do insure that decisions can be made while you or your loved one is alive. If you are the person acting on someone else’s behalf, the POA gives you legal standing to do so. To use legal terminology, you stand in that person’s shoes. </p> <br> <strong>Tips:</strong> <ol type="1"> <li> Give only one person power of attorney at a time and grant it for specific functions. It may seem best to put down all your children, for example, to make joint financial, real estate or legal decisions on your behalf. The reality is that in the chaos that can accompany traumatic injury, palliative care or impending death, committees can’t act quickly. One person needs to be able to make the decisions. </li> <li> Similarly, make sure that you identify an alternative “attorney” if the first one becomes unable to serve. For example, if a spouse is given power of attorney, make sure another family member or friend is in line. The spouse may be in an accident with the person; the spouse may develop dementia. If there is no power of attorney, the only means to make decisions on another’s behalf is to create a guardianship. </li> <li> Think very carefully about who you want to make end-of-life decisions for you. Sometimes it isn’t a family member. </li> <li> Don’t assume a person feels comfortable being given this role. Ask first. </li> <li> Consider splitting different financial and legal functions between two or more people so that they have oversight of each other and all of the responsibility is not on one person. </li> <li> Give the person you have identified a copy of the power of attorney. Most likely they will have to sign it, but also make sure they have it for their records. If you have an attorney, give one to him or her as well. </li> <li> Parents may execute a POA for guardianship of their children. This allows someone to stand in the shoes of a parent for medical, financial and legal decisions while the parent is alive. If, for example, you are in a car accident, it will allow friends and healthcare providers to be able to talk with that person if the children are injured, to make decisions about the child’s medical needs. It only works, however, when the parents are alive. </li> </ol> <br> <p> Note: Guardianships provide broader powers than POAs but are sometimes thought of as equivalent. Guardianships tend to be created only in instances in which a person is severely mentally impaired or a child. It can be important if there are concerns that a loved one is the victim of a crime or a potential victim. It is an expensive process, however, and requires court oversight, which is very demanding. Consult with an attorney before considering that step. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row" id="preparingEssentials"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>Preparing – The Essentials</h4> <p> The more you prepare, the easier it will be for your family or heirs to carry out your wishes. For some people, keeping records is part of a normal life. For others, an organized filing cabinet is a vague dream. Wherever you fall in the spectrum, at least prepare The Essentials. </p> <p> <strong>Check with your bank to make sure it will allow access to joint bank accounts after the death of one of the parties and prior to receipt of a death certificate.</strong> It sounds bizarre but some banks interpret their obligation to protect a person’s assets to include closing access to joint accounts until after receipt of a death certificate and legal instructions from the estate. This process can take several weeks. If your loved one’s bank has that policy, consider opening a separate account before the death, or discuss other options with financial advisors or the bank. </p> <p> <strong>Make a list of persons to be contacted in case of death.</strong> No one wants to go through someone else’s address book or contact lists to determine who should be contacted. Make a list, for yourself or your loved one, and revisit it every year or so. From doctors to friends to business acquaintances, don’t make a loved one bear the burden of trying to figure out who to call or send a card/notification. </p> <p> <strong>Identify important financial, insurance, investment and other records, even if you don’t organize them.</strong> These records include, but aren’t necessarily limited to: </p> <ul> <li> Bank accounts and lines of credit; </li> <li> Investment accounts; </li> <li> Real estate (including mortgages); </li> <li> Cars (including loans, registration and “pink slips”); </li> <li> Credit cards; </li> <li> Debts; </li> <li> Insurance coverage (property, vehicle, health, disability); </li> <li> Life insurance; </li> <li> 401(k) or other retirement investments; </li> <li> Employer(s) (in the event there are benefits); </li> <li> Pensions; </li> <li> Computer, phone and other passwords; </li> <li> Location of legal documents; </li> <li> Names and locations of attorneys, accountants, healthcare providers and wealth management counselors </li> <li> Frequent flyer accounts and passwords (hey, you earned those miles; someone should use them!) </li> <li> Location of valuable possessions (e.g., safe deposit box, sock drawer, box buried under the azaelea) </li> <li> Military records (for benefits). </li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="row" id="theBody"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>The Body</h4> <p> There is nothing more fundamental than dealing with the body of someone who dies. And there is no aspect of death that we want to talk about less. Does a person have a choice to die at home? After death, what does the family have to do and how quickly? Do you have to go to the funeral home? Do you need a casket? </p> <p> <strong>The option to die at home requires planning.</strong> State laws and local ordinances can significantly impact whether it makes sense for you or a loved one to die at home rather than in a hospital. Medical personnel, particularly hospice professionals, can be particularly helpful in determining when and under what circumstances a terminally ill or injured person can go home to die. They also can tell you in straightforward terms the pros and cons of a hospital vs. a home death. These are a series of conversations that need to take place with the person who is dying, his or her healthcare providers, hospital administrators and the family. There should be a frank conversation about pain management and the physical burden that in-home death can place on family members so that everyone is aware of the trade-offs. </p> <p> <strong>Bodies are usually taken to funeral homes.</strong> State laws require that a person’s death be confirmed by a medical professional. If death occurs at a residence, the treating healthcare provider should be notified. If no healthcare provider has been caring for the deceased, the County Coroner should be called. Once death has been confirmed, you will be asked where the body should be sent. If the death occurs at a hospital or nursing home, the facility will notify a mortuary (funeral home) after consultation with the family. Transportation of the body will take place within an hour or so after the death unless other arrangements are made. Embalming of a body is not usually legally or medically necessary and it adds to the cost.At a minimum, mortuaries/funeral homes, can transport the body to their facility and prepare death certificates. In some states, cremation societies can provide transportation directly to the cremation site and prepare death certificates. What you and your loved ones choose to do will be based on considerations as varied as religious beliefs, ethnic or family traditions, finances and even ecological values. The best course is to talk through what you or your loved one would want before the death occurs or before it is so imminent that it is unbearably painful to discuss. </p> <p> <strong>Tips:</strong> <ul> <li> If there is a viewing of the body, some states require the body to be embalmed. If there is no viewing, embalming is not usually required. </li> <li> If the funeral home does not have a refrigerator and the body will not be buried for more than a few days, some states require embalming. </li> </ul> </p><br> <p> <strong>Burial or cremation. </strong> Bodies can be buried or cremated. One is not necessarily any less expensive or complicated than the other. State and local laws often limit where people can be buried and where ashes can be distributed. All states require a body to be placed in a casket, at least up to the point of cremation. If the body is to be buried, it can be buried either in the ground or in a mausoleum. </p> <br> <p> <strong>Tips:</strong> <ol type="1"> <li> Don’t assume cremation is less costly. Cremation costs, in particular, can vary widely. </li> <li> By law, estimates for both must be provided over the phone. These costs can vary by as much as five-fold among various mortuaries and whether you call for an estimate beforehand. </li> <li> If you know you or your loved one wants to be buried in the ground, look for a burial plot as early as possible. For some, knowing where their body or ashes will remain is a great comfort. It also can ease family pain to know there is a specific place to visit a loved one. On a purely practical level, the cost of a “pre-need” plot can be literally half the price of one bought when the body needs to be buried. Similarly, if the loved one wants their ashes or body placed in a mausoleum, a pre-death purchase can substantially ease decision-making (and cost) at a difficult time. </li> <li> If the deceased is an honorably discharged veteran or the spouse of such a veteran, he or she is entitled to a free burial at the Veteran Affairs National Cemetery. Some states also have veteran cemeteries that offer the same service. </li> <li> If the deceased and the family do not care what happens to the body, consider organ donation. These are arranged before death and provide a valuable service to the living. </li> <li> Joining a non-profit cremation society prior to death often represents the least expensive option but their availability varies from state to state. </li> </ol> </p> <p> <strong>Burial at home - </strong> A number of states and municipalities have laws regulating or even prohibiting burial on private property that is not specifically zoned or licensed for that purpose. This is the sort of information best obtained from funeral homes or government agencies in your area. </p><br> <p> <strong>Scattering or planting cremains – </strong> If you intend to scatter the cremains, bear in mind these are not fireplace ashes. Some are as fine as dust and just as difficult to cast into the wind. Others can be the weight of pebbles and small rocks, or are even the size of bone pieces, which is what they are. For some people, this can be troubling. </p><br> <p> If you want to bury ashes near a tree, in a garden or create a garden for them, be sure to ask your local nursery about what kind of plants are best and how to prepare the soil. Cremains contain high pH and sodium levels and you will want to take that into consideration when deciding what and how to plant. The last thing you would want is to have the plants near the cremains die. </p><br> <p> If you intend to scatter ashes on public land, many parks require a permit to do so. There are companies that, for a fee, will charter planes, buses or boats to take you anywhere you want to plant or scatter ashes. </p><br> <p> <strong>Tips:</strong> <ol type="1"> <li> If you bury the ashes on public land, where no marker can be placed, remember to place the coordinates on a GPS so you or others will be able to visit it again. </li> <li> If you or your loved one is an American citizen who wants their ashes scattered at sea, the U.S. Coast Guard usually will do it at no cost. Arrangements must be made through your local Coast Guard chaplain’s office. </li> </ol> </p> </div> </div> <div class="row" id="funeral"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>Funeral Decisions</h4> <p> Funeral homes can be very helpful and supportive. They also can be expensive. It’s best to take the time to choose one before you need one. There’s nothing wrong with checking Yelp. </p> <p> Take someone with you when you go to a funeral home to discuss arrangements. The decisions you have to make can be very difficult and you are making them at a time when it will be challenging to concentrate. Having someone there whom you trust — who will know when you are tiring or uncomfortable — can make a big difference. </p> <p> Funeral homes and cremation societies tend to operate on line items; in other words, each piece has a particular cost. Transportation from the hospital to the funeral home, from the funeral home to the church, and then from the church to the burial site are usually separate costs. Many people find it helpful to take these things into account because decisions about the service can substantially affect the cost. </p> <p> <strong>Tips:</strong> <ol type="1"> <li> Federal law requires funeral homes to provide a copy of their price lists to clients. If possible, ask for the list before you meet with the funeral director so that you can ask informed questions. Often the lists you are given will be packages but federal law also requires funeral homes to provide a price list of all of their caskets. </li> <li> Some funeral homes do not like to provide copies of casket prices, but reputable businesses will give you the information. There are many, many options (see below) and the choices initially can be overwhelming. </li> <li> Read “packages” carefully. Sometimes the very aspects that make it an economic deal are services that you or your family don’t want. </li> </ol> </p> <br> <p> <strong>Death Certificates</strong> <br> Funeral homes prepare death certificates. You will be asked how many you want. These are needed to close every bank or credit card account, sell property, obtain information to determine all the assets to be distributed and for beneficiaries to collect benefits. It is likely you will need no less than 10 and perhaps more than 20. Think about the variety of financial and legal records that may exist when you order them. </p> <p> <strong>Caskets and urns</strong> <br> Caskets are for bodies; urns are for ashes. State laws require that the body be kept in a casket through cremation or burial. States often require that ashes be placed in an urn before leaving the crematorium. </p> <br> <p> <strong>Caskets – </strong> Choosing a casket can be the most difficult part of the already difficult trip to the mortuary. Caskets come in an almost endless variety of shapes, styles, colors and materials. They can be personalized or generic, biodegradable or impermeable. They often are the most expensive item on your list. It’s a good idea to have a clear idea of how important a container for the body is to the person who died and to the family. </p> <br> <p> If the body will be cremated, you literally can choose a cardboard or paper casket if you wish. The more common choice is a wood casket. These are personal decisions; none are right or wrong and none show more or less respect for the body or the person. </p><br> <p> Wood caskets come in everything from pine to mahogany, finely polished or natural, carved or inlaid, adorned or unadorned. They can be biodegradable or advertised as built to withstand the elements. Fiberglass caskets are also available. Choices in metal caskets include stainless steel, copper and bronze. They all can be embossed, filigreed or painted. There are a number of options for handles and hinges, linings and ribbons, pillows and stuffing. Some funeral homes sell “protective” caskets, which are advertised as being moisture-sealed. </p><br> <p> <strong>Tips:</strong> <ol type="1"> <li> Asking about cost does not make you appear cheap. Ask to see low-cost caskets if that is what you want. </li> <li> Some funeral homes will let you rent a casket for the service that is not the burial casket. If all you want is a temporary casket or urn, say so. </li> <li> You do not have to buy a casket from a funeral home. Yes, Costco, Amazon and casket manufacturers sell caskets. Consider reviewing those sites before you go to the funeral home. </li> <li> If you or your loved one wants a biodegradable casket, consider asking about Kosher or Orthodox Jewish caskets. Sometimes they are substantially less than those labeled “eco-friendly” caskets and they are required to be biodegradable. </li> <li> If an eco-burial is important to you or a loved one, there are a number of options and they continue to grow. You can get more information at the non-profit Website of the Green Burial Council. <a>www.greenburialcouncil.org</a> </li> </ol> </p><br> <br> <p> <strong>Urns - </strong> Cremains are usually kept in urns. What kind of urn you want or need depends upon how and where the ashes will be kept. If the cremains will be buried in a cemetery plot or placed in a mausoleum, your particular state or locality may have regulations about the size or material of the container. Cemeteries also may have their own requirements, so check before you make a decision. </p><br> <p> Decorative urns, which are sold at funeral homes and crematoriums, can be made of metal, wood or ceramic and are offered in a number of styles, colors and sizes. They can be personalized with names, dates, quotes or photographs. These may be particularly desired if they are to be placed somewhere they will be viewed. In some cases, an urn will be nothing more than a temporary place to keep the cremains. </p><br> <p> <strong>Newspaper obituaries.</strong> Most funeral homes will write an obituary — or history of the deceased person’s life — if you request it. Usually they will ask whether you want the obituary published in a local newspaper. This can be surprisingly expensive, with small daily newspapers charging upwards of $500 and metro newspaper obituaries running in the thousands of dollars. </p> <br> <p> Most newspapers do not keep digital copies of the paid obituaries. In other words, the paid obituary will not show up on an Internet search or a search on the newspaper’s website after a certain number of weeks. If you want copies, make arrangements with the newspaper or download the obit during the advertising period. </p><br> <p> You may want to consider online publication either in conjunction with or an alternative to “paper and ink” publishing. This can be less expensive and have greater reach. </p><br> <p> <strong>Funerals and Memorial Services</strong> Services most often take place in a funeral home or place of worship. There is nothing wrong with holding a memorial service somewhere else, however, such as a place that has great meaning to the person for whom the service is being held. Services can be as varied as the people who are being remembered. Also bear in mind that ritual can be very important to family and friends. </p><br> <p> It is customary for the family to host the service if it is in a funeral home; they will greet guests as they arrive. In a place of worship, the family will sit in the front, as at a wedding. The family generally chooses who will speak at the service and in what order. There often is an opportunity for others to speak at the end of the service. </p> <br> <p> There is often a guestbook placed near the entryway so that the family will be able to remember who came. Bringing a photo of the deceased is often appreciated. </p><br> <p> <strong>Funeral service.</strong> Funerals often take place within a week or ten days of the death, particularly if the death is not sudden. In the past, the body was present at a funeral; that is no longer the norm. Funerals are generally held before the body is buried or cremated. </p><br> <p> Funeral service followed by burial of body or cremains. If the body or cremains are part of the service, the burial generally takes place immediately after the funeral. Often only family and close friends are invited to the burial. </p><br> <p> <strong>Memorial service.</strong> A memorial service tends to be more informal than a funeral, sometimes in a home, outside or a favorite spot. They tend to be held after the body is buried, but can be held before or after a body is cremated. Memorial services can be scheduled to accommodate those who must travel or in conjunction with a holiday or other special date. Sometimes the memorial service includes cremains to be scattered or buried. </p> <br> <p> <strong>Tips:</strong> <ol type="1"> <li>To the extent you can, give yourself and your loved one time to talk about options for a service. Some people like to envision loved ones celebrating or going on a trip after they die. Others have no interest.</li> <li> Ritual and stories can be very healing. </li> <li> Consider that you can have a funeral for the family and a memorial for a larger group later. </li> </ol> </p><br> <p> It is customary for the family to offer refreshments after a service. Sometimes the family will also invite guests to another location for a meal. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>The Estate</h4> <p> By estate, we don’t mean your home or that huge mansion on the other side of town; your estate is everything you own that will be distributed after your death. If you have a trust or a will, the executor or trustee will have that responsibility. Without sufficient information and planning, it can be a difficult and overwhelming task. </p><br> <p> <strong>Probate.</strong> Each state has its own probate laws. Probate is a legal process for administering estates of people who die without a will or when there is potential dispute over the contents of a will or trust. </p><br> <p> In cases where a person dies without a will (“intestate”), probate courts will determine who gets what from the estate. That means the potential heirs will have to hire attorneys and the estate will have to pay their fees to assist the court in figuring out what the deceased wanted done. This depletes the value of the estate and vastly increases the time it takes to distribute the estate. </p><br> <p> If a dispute might arise amongst the heirs because a will is not clear, probate courts will be needed to determine its legality and the intent of the deceased through a court action. If there is a dispute over a trust, probate courts must monitor and approve actions by the estate’s executor or administrator. Again lawyers must be hired and the estate is depleted. </p><br> <p> In short, you want to avoid probate. </p><br> <p> <strong>Distribution without probate.</strong> There are a number of ways that property can be distributed after a death and without going through the court system. </p><br> <p> One is through contractual beneficiary designations. For example, retirement accounts and life insurance policies are contracts that have beneficiaries identified in the document. The company that administers those policies or accounts must pay the designated amount to the designated person, whether or not that person would otherwise inherit that money, after a death certificate is received. </p><br> <p> Another way to distribute property is through joint ownership, which is a relatively common form of ownership in real estate and bank accounts. If the document states it is a joint ownership, the surviving owner automatically becomes the sole owner. The property is put in the sole owner’s name after a death certificate is provided. </p><br> <p> Good wills and trusts also allow distribution without probate. As a general rule, an executor or trustee will need to do the following: </p> <ul> <li> Go through the deceased’s calendar and bills to avoid incurring estate expenses and to make sure insurance and other accounts are kept current; </li> <li> Cancel credit cards; </li> <li> Notify all creditors and supply a death certificate to each; </li> <li> Notify all insurance companies (auto, health, home owners, in particular); </li> <li> If the deceased was employed, contact the human resources and benefits departments to find out about salary, health insurance, employment termination payments and potential life insurance or 401(k) contributions; </li> <li> Contact all previous employers to determine whether there are benefits associated with those employers as well; </li> <li> Order enough death certificates to cover all accounts. It is easier and cheaper to order 10 or more at the outset than to have to order more later; </li> <li> Dispose of property identified in the will or trust promptly; </li> <li> Prepare and retain individual records of receipt by beneficiaries; </li> <li> Take care of the sale of the deceased’s home. A good realtor can advise you on whether or which improvements will yield the best return; </li> <li> Go through all of the deceased’s business records to identify property; </li> <li> Obtain copies of all life insurance policies, retirement accounts and other contracts with third party beneficiaries; </li> <li> Prepare financial records and arrange for final tax preparation; </li> <li> Dispose of property not included in the will or trust; </li> <li> Research the state and federal death tax laws to determine to what extent money needs to be set aside to pay taxes at the end of the year </li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="row" id="potentialBenefits"> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <h4>Potential Benefit Entitlements</h4> <p> There are a number of single-time benefits that survivors may be entitled to receive. </p><br> <p> <strong>Federal government.</strong> When the deceased has paid into the Social Security system, the government provides a one-time benefit for spouses and dependents. A surviving spouse receives a single lump-sum death payment of $255 if she or he was living in the same household with the deceased immediately before he or she died. If they were living apart, the surviving spouse can still receive the lump-sum if, during the month the worker died, he or she was already receiving Social Security benefits from the deceased or became <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/survivorplan/ifyou2.htm">eligible for benefits upon the spouse’s death</a>. If there is no eligible surviving spouse, the lump sum is paid to the child (or children) of the deceased under the same circumstances. Survivors must apply for this payment within two years of the date of death. For more information about this lump-sum payment, <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/locator/">contact your local Social Security office</a> or call 1 800 772 1213. </p> <br> <p> <strong>Workers’ compensation programs. </strong> Some states offer death benefits through their workers’ compensation programs if the death was the result of a work-related injury. </p><br> <p> <strong>Unions.</strong> Public employees and members of unions often have death benefits or survivors’ trust funds. </p><br> <p> <strong>Employers.</strong> Private companies sometimes have benefits that provide lump sums to survivors. Those can include life insurance, disability and health insurance payments. Contact the employer’s human resources department. </p> <p> <strong>Health insurance policies. </strong> Some health insurance policies have death benefits so these should be reviewed as well. </p> </div> </div> </tab> <!-- end practicalities tab --> </div> <div class="col-sm-2 col-xs-2 col-md-2 tab"> <!-- start volunteer tab --> <tab heading="Volunteer"> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-12"></div> <span ng-repeat="item in responseJson.volunteer"> <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-4 donate-thumb"> <a href="{{item.url}}"><img src="{{item.path}}"></a> </div> </span> </div> </div> </tab> <!-- end volunteer tab --> </div> <div class="col-sm-2 col-xs-2 col-md-2 tab"> <!--start donate tab --> <tab heading="Donate"> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-12"></div> <span ng-repeat="item in responseJson.donate"> <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-4 donate-thumb"> <a href="{{item.url}}"><img src="{{item.path}}"></a> </div> </span> </div> </div> </tab> <!-- end donate tab --> </div> <div class="col-sm-2 col-xs-2 col-md-2 tab"> <!-- start gifts tab --> <tab heading="Gifts"> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-12"></div> <h3>Cards</h3> <span ng-repeat="item in responseJson.gifts.cards"> <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-4 donate-thumb"> <a href="{{item.url}}"><img src="{{item.path}}"></a> </div> </span> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-12"></div> <h3>Activities</h3> <span ng-repeat="item in responseJson.gifts.activities"> <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-4 donate-thumb"> <a href="{{item.url}}"><img src="{{item.path}}"></a> </div> </span> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-12"></div> <h3>Things</h3> <span ng-repeat="item in responseJson.gifts.things"> <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-4 donate-thumb"> <a href="{{item.url}}"><img src="{{item.path}}"></a> </div> </span> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-12"></div> <h3>Food</h3> <span ng-repeat="item in responseJson.gifts.food"> <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-4 donate-thumb"> <a href="{{item.url}}"><img src="{{item.path}}"></a> </div> </span> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-12"></div> <h3>Wineries</h3> <span ng-repeat="item in responseJson.gifts.wineries"> <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-4 donate-thumb"> <a href="{{item.url}}"><img src="{{item.path}}"></a> </div> </span> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-12"></div> <h3>Plants</h3> <span ng-repeat="item in responseJson.gifts.plants"> <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-4 donate-thumb"> <a href="{{item.url}}"><img src="{{item.path}}"></a> </div> </span> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-12"></div> <h3>Gift Certificates</h3> <span ng-repeat="item in responseJson.gifts.gift_certificates"> <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-4 donate-thumb"> <a href="{{item.url}}"><img src="{{item.path}}"></a> </div> </span> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-12"></div> <h3>Services</h3> <span ng-repeat="item in responseJson.gifts.services"> <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-4 donate-thumb"> <a href="{{item.url}}"><img src="{{item.path}}"></a> </div> </span> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-12"></div> <h3>Perpetual</h3> <span ng-repeat="item in responseJson.gifts.perpetual"> <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-6 col-md-4 donate-thumb"> <a href="{{item.url}}"><img src="{{item.path}}"></a> </div> </span> </div> </div> </tab> <!-- end gifts tab --> </div> </tabset> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
