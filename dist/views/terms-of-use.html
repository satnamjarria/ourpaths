It specifically reserves the right to block any user or remove any content it reasonably believes, in its sole discretion, has violated any of the Rules of Use. In rare cases, that could include removal of a memorial, room or rooms. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1"> <h3 class="bold"> Reporting Abuse </h3><br> <p> We want OurPaths to be a safe place to connect, share, learn, grieve, discover and communicate. We are committed to providing an environment in which shared memories and stories can change lives and make history come alive. To create that kind of community, we need to respect that the world is a diverse place with diverse opinions and multiple modes of expression. You may not always be comfortable with what you see. </p> <p> But there are limits, particularly in public rooms. </p> <p> If you object to content of any kind on one of your memorials or rooms, even if it may not violate OurPaths’ Terms of Use, you have complete authority as an Owner or Curator to delete it. You also have the authority to ban individual users from your memorials at your sole discretion and without speaking with anyone. We ask, however, that you take the time to report objectionable conduct to us at support@OurPaths.com. This allows us to take appropriate action and to take further action if the problem is repeated on other memorials by the same user or group of users. </p> <p> If you encounter objectionable material on a site you are visiting that you believe violates our Terms of Use or otherwise infringes or violates any third party intellectual property rights, rights of publicity or other third party rights, please also report it to us at support@OurPaths.com. Because of the diversity of the OurPaths’ community, bear in mind that what is disagreeable or disturbing to you may nonetheless be within the bounds of our Rules of Use and, therefore, we may not require that it be removed. In that case, you have the option and ability to cut ties with that person or memorial if you do not want to view the objectionable material. </p> <p> Notwithstanding our commitment to provide all users with a safe and respectful community, we also remind you that you use the Application at your sole risk and OurPaths shall have no liability for material that you may find objectionable, nor does OurPaths guarantee the accuracy of any information placed on the Application by third parties. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1"> <h3 class="bold">Your Rights and Obligations</h3><br> <h3 class="bold">Your Cooperation and Notification</h3><br> <p> You agree to cooperate with all reasonable requests of OurPaths and will notify OurPaths promptly upon learning of any actual or suspected breach of these Terms of Use or upon learning of any unauthorized use or abuse of this Application. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1"> <h3 class="bold">Users</h3> <p> You do not have to register in order to use OurPaths’ informational sections or to browse featured or popular memorials. Those who want to sign the guestbook, add wishes or prayers, create or contribute to an interactive obituary or build memorials and meeting places must register and become a Member. Different levels of access are granted based upon what kind of user you choose to be. </p> <p> Visitors are users who choose not to open an OurPaths account. Visitors are free to browse all non-private sites on the Application and to utilize all the resources and support we offer. However, they are not able to interact, i.e., add guest comments, wishes or prayers or purchase offerings at the sites. </p> <p> Members are users who have registered to create an OurPaths account. This allows interactive access. There is no charge for becoming a Member. Members may add wishes or prayers and sign the guestbook in any public room. Registration also gives a user the ability to create memorials and rooms of their own and invite others to visit those spaces. Members have access, upon invitation, to private rooms. They may buy furnishings, photo frames, furniture and other objects to place in their and others’ rooms, depending on the access granted by the Owner or Curator of the memorial. </p> <p> Guests are users who are invited to view a memorial, usually through a social media site like Facebook or Google+. Guests can be Visitors or Members. </p> <p> Contributors are Guests who are invited by the Owner or Curator of the memorial to contribute photos, memories and videos to the Timeline. One of the unique aspects of OurPaths is the ability for a number of users to easily contribute to the storytelling. </p> <p> Owners and Curators create, design and have complete authority over the memorials and rooms they build. The Owner is the purchaser of the memorial and has the option to assign a Curator at his or her discretion. Both the Curator and Owner may provide information, photos and videos that initially create the Biography and Timeline. If they choose, they may grant others access to add events, photos and video to the Timeline by inviting them to be Contributors. The Owner or Curator chooses the venue/room for the 3D part of the memorial and has sole control over the objects, photos and furnishings in the rooms. </p> <p> The Owner or Curator also determines whether the memorials and rooms are public or private. The Owner or Curator of a memorial has full authority to delete or otherwise remove any material from the memorial that he or she believes, in his or her sole discretion, is inappropriate, unwanted or objectionable. The Owner or Curator also has the right to ban individual users from the memorial or room. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1"> <h3 class="bold">The Memorials</h3> <p> The OurPaths Application provides users with the ability to create 3D interactive memorials. These memorials can be the project of one person, a family, a group of people or literally groups all around the world. Some Owners will want to collaborate with others; some will want it to be a solo project. Some of you will put together memorials for a funeral service or life celebration. Others will want a 21st century obituary for the world to see. Others will want it to be the equivalent of a private shrine or the entrance to a private virtual party. </p> <p> No matter what kind of memorial you build, the Owner controls all access to and content on the memorial. </p> <p> Public Memorials are just that: public. They can be viewed in their entirety by anyone visiting the Application or anyone who searches for information on that person on the Internet. If you do not specifically choose to make the memorial private, it will be public by default. </p> <p> In a public memorial, the Owner determines who else (if anyone) will be able to contribute content to the Biography or Timeline of the memorial, which is how photos and video are usually added. Members will be able to add Wishes or Prayers, which can include photos, and sign the guestbook. </p> <p> Public memorials may be included in the Featured Memorials on the Home page of the Application. They also are used to populate the Home page’s list of most popular memorials. Our hope is that OurPaths’ Home page will be filled with public memorials to unsung heroes, favorite relatives, little-known scientists, life-changing mentors, under-appreciated artists and Members’ loved ones from around the world </p> <p> Private memorials are memorials in which portions are private. These can be open to as few or as many users as the Owner decides. They can be designated as invitation-only. </p> <p> Even a private memorial will have one page – the Biography – that is public. To get any further into the memorial, i.e., to a room or rooms or to the Timeline, requires an invitation from the Owner. Who to invite and what access to provide is in the sole control of the Owner. The memorial can be a collection of private rooms that are open only to you and those you select. For example, you can create a room for yourself, a room for family, a room for your loved one’s school friends or athletic groups. Each room can have its individual guest list. You can allow other people to contribute photos, video, important events in the deceased’s life, or you can limit it only to what you want in that room or Timeline. Remember that there is no limit to the number of memorials that can be made for a single person. Feel free to make your memorial your own. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1"> <h3 class="bold">Non-Revocable Grant of Access to Memorials By OurPaths Administrators</h3> <p> As an Owner or Curator, you grant full, complete and non-revocable access to OurPaths’ administrators, including but not limited to employees, contractors and other third parties in order to perform routine maintenance, perform updates, and to ensure the memorial is being used in accordance with the Application’s Rules and Terms of Use. OurPaths retains the right, in its sole discretion, to remove, alter or close access to a memorial that it reasonably believes violates the Terms of Use. In most cases, such action will not be taken without communication with and permission of the Owner or Curator. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1"> <h3 class="bold">Functional Compatibility and System Abuse</h3> <p> As a user, you agree that you will not attempt to and will not damage, corrupt, tamper with or infect this Application, its Content or any information or telecommunication system of OurPaths with a virus or other malicious computer program.

These Terms of Use are subject to change from time to time. OurPaths will endeavor to post a notice of any changes to these Terms of Use for a period of thirty (30) days following any such modifications. Therefore, you are advised to review these Terms of Use occasionally, or at least every thirty (30) days. Your continued use of this Application subsequent to OurPaths’ notice of modification of these Terms of Use shall constitute your acceptance of the modified Terms of Use. If any term or provision of these Terms of Use shall be found to be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, such finding shall not affect the other terms or provisions of these Terms of Use, or the whole of these Terms of Use, but such term or provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to render such term or provision enforceable, and the rights and obligations of you and OurPaths shall be construed and enforced accordingly, preserving to the fullest permissible extent the intent and agreements set forth in these Terms of Use. Your obligations pursuant to these Terms of Use shall survive termination of any use by you of this Application, any Content on this Application, or these Terms of Use. </p> <h3 class="bold"> Applicable Law </h3> <p> By using this Application, you agree that the laws of the United States and the State of California, without regard to conflict of laws principles, will govern all matters between you and OurPaths with respect to your use of this Application. </p> <h3 class="bold">Dispute Resolution Agreement; Applicable Law and Forum</h3> <p> By using this Application you agree to abide by the terms of this Dispute Resolution Procedure. Please read this provision carefully to ensure that you understand it. You are agreeing to binding arbitration as the sole and exclusive means of resolving any and all existing or potential disputes or claims with OurPaths. If you do not agree with this provision, do not use this Application. </p> <h3 class="bold">Agreement to Act in Good Faith and Cooperate</h3> <p> With respect to any and all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Application or these Terms of Use, OurPaths and you agree to negotiate in good faith and undertake reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution. </p> <h3 class="bold"> Agreement to Binding Individual Arbitration </h3> <p> OurPaths and you agree that any and all disputes relating to or arising from the use of this Application, these Terms of Use or any other matter between you and OurPaths shall be exclusively governed by and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S. C. Section 2, et seq. (the “Agreement”). This means that each party waives the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action for damages for all claims, including but not limited to those based in contract, common law, tort, statute, administrative action, equity or any other legal theory. Instead, we agree to resolve the dispute solely and exclusively through binding arbitration. </p> <p> An arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution process that avoids the costs of court for both you and OurPaths. Together the parties will choose a mutually acceptable arbitrator, who is not necessarily a judge, who listens to the evidence and makes a decision based on the law and application of the law to this Agreement and any facts either side believes are relevant. </p> <p> Any demand for arbitration by either party shall be filed within the statute of limitation that is applicable to the claim(s) upon which arbitration is sought or required. Any failure to demand arbitration within this period shall constitute a waiver of all rights to raise any claims in any forum arising out of any dispute that was subject to arbitration. </p> <p> The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules (“Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The AAA can provide you with information about the arbitration process that is designed for non-lawyers. </p> <p> To initiate an arbitration, either OurPaths or you must file a Notice of Arbitration, which is available on the AAA website. If you initiate the arbitration, you will need to pay the initial filing fee. Under this Agreement, you will not have to pay any more for the arbitration than you would pay in court filing fees to press your claim. </p> <p> The arbitrator will be chosen under the process set forth in AAA Rules. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement and OurPaths’ Terms of Use. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. </p> <p> Unless you and OurPaths agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county of your home address. If the claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that the party initiating arbitration may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. </p> <p> If the arbitrator finds in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator will determine the amount of damages or other remedies, if any, that you are entitled to receive. Damages and remedies shall be determined consistent with the applicable law and any additional provisions contained in this Agreement. </p> <p> The arbitrator’s decision shall be conclusive and binding, and it may thereafter be confirmed as a judgment by the court of applicable jurisdiction, subject only to challenge on the grounds under applicable law. </p> <h3 class="bold">Waiver of Class Arbitration</h3> <p> OurPaths and you agree that any and all disputes relating to or arising from the use of this Application, these Terms of Use or any other matter between you and OurPaths shall be brought by you in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class proceeding. Unless such waiver is inconsistent with applicable state law, the parties also agree to waive any right to bring a representative action. </p> <p> The arbitrator’s decision shall be conclusive and binding, and it may thereafter be confirmed as a judgment by the court of applicable jurisdiction, subject only to challenge on the grounds under applicable California law. </p> <h3 class="bold">Permitted Use of Preliminary Injunctive Relief</h3> <p> OurPaths and you agree that either party is entitled to obtain preliminary injunctive relief to the extent allowed by law to enforce any of the terms of these Terms of Use pending a final arbitral decision. </p> <h3 class="bold">Contact Information</h3> <p> If you have any questions regarding these Terms of Use or this Application, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:support@ourpaths.com">support@ourpaths.com</a> or <a href="mailto:legal@ourpaths.com">legal@ourpaths.com</a> </p> </div> </div> </div>
