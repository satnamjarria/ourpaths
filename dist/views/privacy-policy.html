We want to share with you how we collect and store this information, how we use it, and under what circumstances we could be compelled to disclose it. We encourage you to read the entire Terms of Use policy that governs the OurPaths Application (the "Application"), of which this is a section. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1"> <h3 class="bold">Information We Collect And Store</h3><br> <p> OurPaths is committed to protecting the privacy and security of the personal information you provide to us. Although you may visit the Application without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself, most visitors choose to register. </p><br> <p> Those sections of the Application (including restricted portions) that request submission of personal information (referred to for convenience as "Registration Pages") contain a function for collecting various pieces of your personal information including, but not limited to, name, address, email address, phone number(s) and credit card or account information. </p> <p> When you register, you will be asked to provide some personal information that allows you to become a Member. You have the right to withhold some of the requested information or to change information in your account settings at any time. We only collect your personal information if you voluntarily submit the information to us. </p> <p> Through certain technologies employed by this Application, however, we also collect non-personally identifiable information about you. For more details about this type of data collection, please refer to the section below on cookies. </p> <p> To protect your security and privacy, we require that you (as opposed to a third party on your behalf) enter the personal information that we collect and that the information be current. However, we disclaim any legal duty to verify the accuracy of any personal data that you provide to OurPaths. </p> <p> You are free to access the personal information we have on file by contacting our Customer Service department by email at support@ourpaths.com. In addition, at any time you can request that we modify or delete your personal information by sending an email to us at <a href="mailto:support@ourpaths.com">support@ourpaths.com</a> with the words “UPDATE MY INFORMATION” in the subject line. In order to protect your security and privacy, OurPaths may take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to making changes to your personal information. </p> <h3 class="bold">What do we use your information for?</h3> <p> The information we collect from you is primarily used to process transactions, personalize your experience on the Application and allow you to create a personalized memorial. We reserve the right, however, to compile, save, use within the scope of our activities, and analyze any and all data that you provide to us or place on the Application throughout the Application. </p> <p> We use the personal information about you that you provide to us for our internal purposes such as responding to your requests for information or materials, contacting you, conducting internal analyses such as surveys and market research, processing and completing orders, processing your payment, administering your account, and administering and developing our business relationship with you or the company you represent. We also use your personal information to communicate with you, such as, for example, to provide you with administrative communications regarding your account or information relating to products, offers, or programs on the Application that may be of interest to you. </p> <p> We do not sell mailing lists or personal information. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties unless (1) you consent to that sharing or (2) we are sharing that information with trusted companies – our vendors – who are contractually bound to use personal information that we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide. These companies provide services such as fulfilling orders you submit, maintaining quality control or collecting and processing information. Others may collect and use personal information you provide to us or place on the Application to better understand the offers, promotions, and types of advertising that are most appealing to our customers. After the information is collected by these third parties, it is aggregated so it is not personally identifiable or tied to you or any other user. If you would prefer that these companies not collect your information, please email us at support@ourpaths.com. </p> <p> We also may share your personal information in the event that our business is transferred to another entity by way of merger, sale of the company’s assets, or otherwise. If you consent to the sharing of your personal information, we may share your information with OurPaths-related entities and selected third parties so that they may provide you with or contact you regarding information and materials that may be of interest to you. Please refer to the section below regarding opting In and out. </p> <p> We may also collect and group demographic and preferences information, responses to surveys and other personal information that we collect from you and any content you place on the Application into an aggregate, non-personally identifiable form for disclosure to our existing or potential business partners, affiliates, sponsors or other third parties. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors to the Application. </p> <p> From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Application, such as how many visitors visit a specific page, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. We collect this information through the use of “cookies” and other tracking technologies, which are discussed in greater detail below in the section on cookies and web beacons. We collect this information in order to determine which areas of the Application are most popular and to enhance the Application for visitors. As with other aggregated data, we may disclose such data to our existing or potential business partners, affiliates, sponsors or other third parties, but this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors to the Application. </p> <p> Finally, in rare circumstances we also may release your information when we reasonably believe release it is necessary to comply with the law, enforce our Terms of Use policies, or protect our or others’ rights, property or safety. </p> <h3 class="bold">How do we protect your information?</h3> <p> OurPaths is committed to safeguarding information concerning and submitted by users like you. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. </p> <p> We offer the use of a secure server.
